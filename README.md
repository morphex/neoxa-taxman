Tools to generate data files (CSV) suitable for accounting purposes for the NEOXA crypto currency 

Copy of the ravencoin-taxman project:

Works with CSV files from

Some random notes:

  Price data for entire 2022 for Neoxa doesn't seem to exist. It might be
  acceptable to set the value to 0 for dates before price data exists, or
  maybe the 1st known value.

  I'm guessing my tax office would accept either, unless we're talking large
  amounts of crypto currency where the 1st known value is the best bet.
